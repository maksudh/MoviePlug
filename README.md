HOW TO RUN ON YOUR DEVICE

You'll need to begin by installing NodeJs and Expo. Assuming you already have NodeJs,
run this command to install expo 'npx expo -h'

Once expo is installed, then run this command 'npm --force install' to install the app and its packages

Next, assuming you have python, you'll need to install 'pyrebase' and 'pandas' if you don't already have them.

Once this is all done, you can run the app using 'expo start' and then run this command for the python script 'python3 crudscript.py'
